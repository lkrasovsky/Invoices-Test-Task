## **Invoices Test Task**

In this project I used MVVM architecture, because itâ€™s faster to implement and good enough for so
small project. Covered InvoiceRepositoryImpl with Unit-tests.

Technologies in use:

- Dagger Hilt: for dependency injection.
- [ZigzagView](https://github.com/beigirad/ZigzagView): to create zigzag effects on invoices.
- Retrofit: for the API requests
- Adapter Delegations: for efficient RecyclerView work.
- Mockk: for mocking classes in Unit test.
- Coroutines-test: for replacing coroutines dispatcher

You can run apk in the root project folder or set up a project and run on your machine.
